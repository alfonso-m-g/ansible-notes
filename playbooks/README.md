You are assigned a task to restart a number of servers in a particular sequence. The sequence and the commands to be used are given below. Note that the commands should be run on respective servers only. Refer to the inventory file and update the playbook to create the below sequence.

    Note: Use the description below to name the plays and tasks.

    Stop the web services on web server nodes - service httpd stop
    Shutdown the database services on db server nodes - service mysql stop
    Restart all servers (web and db) at once - /sbin/shutdown -r
    Start the database services on db server nodes - service mysql start
    Start the web services on web server nodes - service httpd start

    Warning: Do not use this playbook in a real setup. There are better ways to do these actions. This is only for simple practise.
